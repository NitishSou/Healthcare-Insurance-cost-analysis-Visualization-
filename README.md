This dataset contains 1338 rows of insured data, where the Insurance charges are given against the following attributes of the insured: Age, Sex, BMI, Number of Children, Smoker and Region. There are no missing or undefined values in the dataset.

Inspiration
This relatively simple dataset should be an excellent starting point for EDA, Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis testing and training Linear Regression models for predicting Insurance Premium Charges.

Proposed Tasks:

1. Exploratory Data Analytics
2. Statistical hypothesis testing
3. Statistical Modeling
4. Linear Regression
